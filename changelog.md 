Changes I made to my protfolio:
- Changed the background to a scrollable image
- Rearranged elements on the pages
- Changed background for different tags such as forms and list
- Added a bilibili API to the about page. The reason I use this API is because if I load my video in it will takes too long for the video to load, and in some browser it just won't load. Therefore, using this API where I uploaded my 
video will load the video immediately.
